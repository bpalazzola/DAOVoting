# Description
University DAO Voting is a meritocratic, decentralized autonomous organization that leverages the wisdom of the crowd. Thanks to blockchain and smart contract - which enables transparency and immutability, we are able to achieve such system.
Each student, at the beginning, of the school year is given an amount of token based on their academic performance last term. For example, a GPA of 3.5 student would be given 350 tokens.
The token is used for voting proposal and comments.
But GPA is not the only factor here. We also introduced the “merit” score - class A (top 15%), class B (next 25%), class C (last 55%). 				

# How does it work:
Any student can place a proposal, the more tokens added to the proposal- the longer voting time period becomes.
To prevent bias, during the voting time - the voting stats are hidden.
A proposal, in order to be approved, needed to go meet two conditions:
Tokens voted on agree is dominant.
Merit score of people who voted on agree is dominant - Unfortunately we did not have time to implement this part yet :)
